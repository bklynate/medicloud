			where {id} is the id generated by mySQL

Full Application Test
---------------------------------
 - We can test this locally after installation or on Medicloud's production server:
 	+ Locally: With all three tiers running, point browser to where web application is hosted. i.e. "localhost"
 	+ Medicloud's production server: Point browser to http://52.88.114.36/
 	
 Test:
 - Click on Health Professional tab on the homepage
 - Click on "Sign Up"
 - Fill out sign up form
 - Click "GO"
 - Check Email for verifidation link
 - Click on the link to receive a confirmation message that every account was verified
 - This indicates that client side server, database and Rest API, 
 	and GMail server are successfully communicating
